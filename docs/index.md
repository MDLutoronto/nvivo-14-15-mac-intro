# Introduction to NVivo 14/15 for Mac

This is a beginner level tutorial for NVivo 14 or 15 for Mac (the versions are almost identical). The goal of this tutorial is to learn about the basic features in NVivo that will allow you to organize and analyze qualitative data. Part 1 will go over the basics of navigating the NVivo interface, importing data, and coding with codes. Part 2 will explore the different types of queries you can run in NVivo. If you already have a grasp of the basics and are just interested in learning about queries, you can jump right to Part 2\.

Before you begin, make sure you have NVivo 14 or 15 installed. If you don’t, [follow these instructions to request a free license key and install the software](https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/technology/tutorials/installing-and-licensing-nvivo-14-or-15-mac).

You’ll also need to download some datasets that we’ve provided for this tutorial. Create a new folder on your computer to store the tutorial files. Download [this zip file containing all the datasets you will need for the tutorial](https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/workshops/NVivoOnline/Mac/WorkshopFiles.zip) to that new folder. Finally, extract the files into that new folder.

Part 1 – The Basics
===================

Creating a New Project
----------------------

1\. First start up NVivo 14 or 15\.

2\. From the main screen, you will see that there are sample projects you can explore to get a feel for NVivo. We will look at one of these later. There are also several links to training and tutorials to learn more. But for us, let’s click on **Create new project** to get started.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Part%201_2.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Nvivo welcome screen ' title='' width='705' height='423' />

3\. You must **give your project and project file a name**, so let’s call them both “NVivo Workshop”. You can add a description if you want.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_New%20Project_3.png' | relative_url }}' alt='NVivo New Project pop up. The project is titled as: NVivo workshop ' title='' width='672' height='570' />

4\. Then **select where you want to save the project file.** **Use the drop\-down arrow to browse folders**. Let’s save it where we have put all our other workshop files.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_New%20Project_4.png' | relative_url }}' alt='NVIVO pop-up selecting NVivo Workshop as the location for the file. ' title='' width='667' height='568' />

5\. Finally **select Create** to create your new project.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_New%20Project_5.png' | relative_url }}' alt='NVivo Pop up with Create Project selected' title='' width='661' height='563' />

 

Explore the Interface
---------------------

1\. Let’s briefly look around before we get started. First off, the left side menu helps you navigate the various items of your project, such as your files, your codes, notes, queries, etc. We will talk about these sections as we use the tool.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Explore%20the%20Interface_1%20Edit_0.png' | relative_url }}' alt='NVivo new project homepage ' title='' width='2580' height='1676' />

2\. If you want to save your project manually (which you should do periodically), or create or open a new project, you can use the File menu from the menu bar at the top of the screen.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Explore%20the%20Interface_2a.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Under file, Save is selected ' title='' width='2546' height='1658' /><img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Explore%20the%20Interface_2b.png' | relative_url }}' alt='' title='' width='2554' height='1670' />

 

3\. If you select **NVivo from the** **menu bar**, and then **Licensing**, you will see an option to **Replace License**, where you can update your license key, when you receive a new one.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Explore%20the%20Interface_3a.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the top menu bar, Nvivo is selected' title='' width='674' height='469' /><img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Explore%20the%20Interface_3b_0.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Under the NVivo tab, Licensing and Replace license are selected ' title='' width='634' height='504' />

 

Import Data
-----------

Next, let’s import some data so we can start using the tool. We will be using transcripts from interviews and focus groups run for a US data center study. As mentioned before, NVivo helps you get organized, so before we import in some data, let’s create some folders to organize our data.

1\. From the left menu, **under Data, hold down the** **Control key** and **click on Files** and **select New Folder**... from the context menu. Let’s call it “Interviews” and **click on Done**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Import%20Data_1a.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Under Data, files is selected. From there, New Folder is selected' title='' width='667' height='449' /><img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Import%20Data_1b.png' | relative_url }}' alt='The name of the new folder is Interviews' title='' width='556' height='543' />

2\. **Create one more folder called “Focus Groups”**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Import%20Data_2.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Two folders have been created, Interviews and Focus Groups' title='' width='607' height='532' />

3\. Next, **go to the Import menu** from within the program and select **Files**.

**Note:** If you do not have Files selected in the Data tab on the left, all options under Import will be greyed out.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Import%20Data_3.png' | relative_url }}' alt='The import tab has been selected within NVivo, and the files tab has been selected from there.' title='' width='2156' height='1196' />

4\. Here you can see some various types of files that NVivo can import. To start, let’s import in our interview transcripts. **Make sure that the Interviews folder is selected on the left**. **Go the Import menu, and from the Files drop\-down menu, select Documents...**

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Import%20Data_4.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Under Import, Documents is selected. Make sure that the Interview file is selected as well. ' title='' width='2206' height='1132' />

5\. **Browse to the folder called “DCEE Focus Groups and Interviews,”** which has all the study files we will look at today.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/nvivo_workshop_mac_015.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Import Documents window at the workshop folder, with the DCEE Focus Groups and Interviews folder highlighted.' title='' width='695' height='387' />

6\. **Highlight only the files starting with “Data Center Interview”** **in the title** in our folder by **selecting the first one, holding down the Shift key**, and then **selecting the last one**. You should have 7 files highlighted. Then **select Import**. This may take a moment to complete.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/nvivo_workshop_mac_016.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Import Documents window at the DCEE Focus Groups and Interviews folder, all Data Center Interview files highlighted and selected. Red box around the Import button.' title='' width='641' height='359' />

7\. Let’s do something similar to import in the focus group information. **Select the Focus Groups** folder on the left. Then **go to the Import menu, and from the Files drop\-down menu, select Documents...**

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Import%20Data_7.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Under Data, Focus Groups are selected. Under the Import tab, Files and then Documents is selected. ' title='' width='798' height='427' />

8\. You should still be in the same folder as last time. This time **highlight the files starting with “NYC”** **in the title**. You should have 8 files and a mix of PDFs and Word Documents. Then **select Import** to import those focus groups files into the Focus Groups folder.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/nvivo_workshop_mac_018.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Import Documents window at the DCEE Focus Groups and Interviews folder, all NYC Data Center files highlighted and selected. Red box around the Import button.' title='' width='636' height='356' />

9\. These files are now all copied into your project file. You can see from the Import menu that there are many different file types that can be imported. For example, you can connect to reference managers to pull in your data (found under the bibliography tab), or from the Files option, you can import in audio files, images, or videos. We won’t be covering them all in this tutorial, but be sure to explore your options later.

**Note:** Files, Classifications, Bibliography, and Notes all have drop down menus with additional import types.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Import%20Data_9.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Red box outlining the options under the Data menu.' title='' width='1670' height='338' />

Creating Codes and Coding
-------------------------

One of the main tasks NVivo is used for is coding. NVivo has a Coding section from the left menu, with a folder called Codes. These codes act like containers to hold all the references to that code.

If you have already decided upon codes ahead of time (following a deductive approach to coding), you can add these codes to NVivo and then start using them. Other times, as mentioned, you will be reading your materials in NVivo and creating codes as you go (an inductive approach to coding). And sometimes you will do a combination of this, where you have a rough idea of some codes you expect to see, but then new codes might emerge for you as your read through the materials. For this example, let’s try this combo method. First, we will create a few codes that we will use to code our materials, and then I will show you how to create codes on the fly as you are reading.

1\. From the left menu, under **Coding, select Codes**. Then go to the **Create menu**,and from the **Code drop\-down menu, select New Code** to create a new code.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_1.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Under the Coding menu on the left, select Codes. Under the top menu select create, code and new code. ' title='' width='728' height='458' />

2\. For the code name **call it “Budget”**. You can add a description for your codes if you like. You can describe them in more detail and give examples of where it would be applied to understand how to use it in coding. We will just leave it blank for now. Ignore the “Aggregate coding from children” option for now. We will discuss it later. **Select Done**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_2.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the code properties pop-up, Budget is the title and done is selected ' title='' width='798' height='425' />

3\. You should now see our new Budget code listed in the Coding folder.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_3.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Under Codes is a code labelled budget.' title='' width='798' height='386' />

4\. **Repeat the last three steps to also create a code called “Maintenance.”** If you make a mistake, you can always select a code and hit the Delete key to remove it (be careful with this option if you have started coding!).

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_4.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Under the Codes section, there are two codes, Budget and Maintenance' title='' width='798' height='390' />

5\. You can also edit your codes after creating them. **Hold down the Control key and** **click on a code to bring up the context menu**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_5.png' | relative_url }}' alt='A menu for one of the codes is open and Get Info is selected.' title='' width='710' height='728' />

6\. If you **select Get Info**, you can rename it or add a description.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_6.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Under the maintenance code menu, the general settings are selected' title='' width='730' height='594' />

7\. Now that we have a couple codes, let’s use them to do some coding. To open up one of our imported files, from the left menu, **go to the Interviews folder under Files and double click on the first interview transcript** to open it in NVivo.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_7.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Under interviews, the first interview is selected' title='' width='2086' height='968' />

Note: NVivo can open a lot of different file types directly in the tool. The files will be open as read\-only, meaning you can’t edit them. This is intentional to prevent error. However, if you happen to notice an error you want to correct, you can select the Edit checkbox at the top of the file. Then you will be able to make changes to the file. Remove the checkmark by clicking on it, to finish editing.

8\. With the file open, you can then read through it and code. **Highlight some text** you want to code, and then **hold down the Control key and click on the highlighted text** to bring up the context menu.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_8.png' | relative_url }}' alt='When holding control and selecting highlighted text, a pop-up appears ' title='' width='734' height='575' />

9\. Select **Code Selection**, and then **To Existing Codes or Cases**…

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_9.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the pop-up menu, select code selection and To existing codes or cases ' title='' width='752' height='499' />

10\. Next, **put a checkmark next to the Code you want to use to code this text**, such as Budget. Then **click on Select**. Now it is coded.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_10.png' | relative_url }}' alt='New code window with the budget node selected' title='' width='618' height='342' />

Note: Generally, you want the text to match the code, but for now, don’t worry if the text doesn’t match, this is just to quickly show you how it works.

11\. Let’s look at an alternative quick way to code. This time before you code, **click on the Codes folder**. This should open up the Codes list next to your transcript.

 

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_11.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Codes list open' title='' width='658' height='350' />

12\. **Highlight some text you want to code**, and then **drag the highlighted text over to the Code** you want to code it. Let’s drag some text over to the Maintenance code. This is a fast and visual way to code. This is a good approach, as you can see the full list of codes while you are coding.

 

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_12.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Some interview text selected, with with a rex box around it and an arrow pointing to the Maintenance code.' title='' width='798' height='369' />

13\. So far we have been coding using our pre\-made codes. However, sometimes, something unexpected might come up that you want to create a new code to code it. **Highlight some text**, and then **hold down the Control key and click on it** to bring up the context menu.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_13.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Some interview text selected, with an open context menu highlighted.' title='' width='638' height='525' />

14\. Now, **select Code Selection** and then **select To New Code**….

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_14.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Context menu with Code Selection opened and To New Code... selected.' title='' width='607' height='513' />

15\. Here you can give it a name, for example, “Teamwork” and **select Done** to create a new code on the fly.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_15.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Code properties with the Name field completed with Teamwork and Done highlighted. ' title='' width='345' height='429' />

16\. So far we have been coding Word documents, but let’s look at the PDFs we imported as well. First **close the current interview transcript you have been working with.** There are a few ways you can do this. These techniques can be used any time you would like to close a window.

Option 1: From the Toolbar at the top of your screen, go to the **View menu, and select Close "\[file name]"**. Alternatively, you can close all items from this menu as well.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_16a_0.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the view drop-down menu, Close "[File name]" is selected.' title='' width='382' height='358' />

Option 2: Hover over the the tab for your item within the program, and select the **X** to close it.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_16b.png' | relative_url }}' alt='On the tab for the open document, there is an x. It is highlighted. ' title='' width='610' height='238' />

Option 3: On the right\-hand side of the screen, select **the icon with three lines**. From there it will give you an option to **Close All**. Please note this option will only let you close all items that are open.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_16c.png' | relative_url }}' alt='An icon with three lines is selected, from there Close All is selected.' title='' width='798' height='399' />

17\. **Go to the Focus Groups folder** and **open up “NYC Data Center FG1 Questionnaire 7”** (you might have to resize the window and/or column to read the full names of the files).

 

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_17.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Left menu with a red box around Focus Groups, Questionnaire 7 highlighted.' title='' width='692' height='193' />

18\. This PDF file has been OCR’ed, meaning you can select text and code it as we have done before. **Try selecting some text**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_18.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Some text selected and highlighted.' title='' width='712' height='509' />

19\. **Now open up “NYC Data Center FG1 Questionnaire 14\.”**

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_19.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Focus Group file list, Questionnaire 14 highlighted.' title='' width='441' height='221' />

20\. This PDF file has not been OCR’ed, meaning you can’t select the text and code it as we have done before. Instead NVivo treats this more like an image. You can **draw a box around a section of text that you would like to code to select it**, and t**hen code as normal**. Generally, though, it is better to make sure that any PDFs you import into NVivo are OCR’ed for ease of coding. This will also be important when running queries, which we will look at later. For now, close these two PDFs.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_20.png' | relative_url }}' alt='A section of the questionnaire that has been selected. Context menu has the code option selected.' title='' width='732' height='494' />

Note: If OCR’ing PDFs is new to you, [this guide](https://guides.library.illinois.edu/c.php?g=347520&p=4116755) might help.

21\. From the left menu, under **Coding**, **select Codes**, and then **double click on a Code** **that has some references** (meaning it has been used to code some text).

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_21.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Codes list a red box around the Budget Code' title='' width='511' height='247' />

22\. Here you will see all the snippets of text that were coded to this Code.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_22.png' | relative_url }}' alt='The Budget Code window with the coded text snippet.' title='' width='620' height='296' />

23\. If you later realize that you mistakenly coded something you didn’t mean to code, you can uncode it. **Highlight one of the references listed**. **Hold down the Control key and click, select Uncode Selection,** and then **select From This Code.**

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding_23.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Context menu for the coded text with Uncode Selection selected and From This Code highlighted.' title='' width='722' height='575' />

 

Working with Codes
------------------

1\. Before we work some more with Codes, **create two more codes called “Energy Efficiency”** **and** **“Water Consumption”.**

2\. Next,**code at least 5 small text fragments to each new code**.

3\. You can see now there are useful counts associated with our codes to see how many files have content that has been coded in that code, and how many text snippets or references have been coded into that code.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Codes_3.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Codes list open and highlighted with the two new codes.' title='' width='519' height='323' />

4\. You will notice that all of our codes are top\-level or parent codes, meaning we haven’t established a hierarchy, none of our codes are nested under other codes. NVivo can help you organize your codes in a hierarchical structure. You are often, in the end, trying to create a hierarchical codes list to group common codes together into broader categories and themes to help make sense of your coding. **Create a new code and call it Sustainability**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Codes_4.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Code properties for a new code with the name field completed with Sustainability and Done highlighted. ' title='' width='432' height='420' />

5\. You could use this code to group some of your existing codes. **Drag Energy Efficiency and Water Consumption** **onto the Sustainability code** (First click on a code to highlight, wait a moment, then drag it on).

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Codes_5.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Energy Efficiency and Water Consumption Nodes selected, with arrows pointing to the Sustainability code.' title='' width='362' height='161' />

6\. Now you can see that they are grouped beneath. Codes grouped beneath another code are called Child Codes.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Codes_6.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Red box around the sustainability code with the two codes nested under it.' title='' width='365' height='167' />

7\. You can use Sustainability as its own broader code now in coding, or just keep it as a heading in the hierarchy. If you **double click on Sustainability**, you should see an empty window pop up as there are no references coded to that Code right now.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Codes_7.png' | relative_url }}' alt='The Sustainability code opened, with no references.' title='' width='798' height='398' />

8\.Hold down the **Control key** and click on **Sustainability** and **select Get Info**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Codes_8.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Context menu for the Sustainability code with a red box around get Info.' title='' width='406' height='621' />

9\. Click the box next to **Aggregate coding from children**. Then **click OK**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Codes_9.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Code properties for the Sustainability Code, with Aggregate coding for children box outlined and checked.' title='' width='419' height='398' />

10\. Now you will see all the references to it, plus its children codes, show up in the window that should be still open. You will need to decide how to want to handle your code hierarchies in terms of this aggregation for your own projects. In some cases, this is very useful, but it may affect queries where references are double counted for the parent and the child. We will talk more about queries later in the tutorial.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Codes_10.png' | relative_url }}' alt='The Sustainability code opened, with all the references from child codes visible.' title='' width='2384' height='1088' />

11\. In the window with all the Sustainability references, **highlight all the text**. A quick way to do this is to click anywhere in that window and press the **Command key** and **A** on your keyboard at the same time to select all.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Codes_11.png' | relative_url }}' alt='The Sustainability code opened, with all the references selected.' title='' width='604' height='494' />

12\. Then **go to the View menu** from the top menu bar, and **select Coding Context,** and then **select Broad**.  
  
<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Codes_12.png' | relative_url }}' alt='View menu drop down is selected, followed by coding context and broad ' title='' width='665' height='336' />

13\. You will see that the references have changed. There is grey text that isn’t coded, but comes directly before or after the coded text to give you more context for what you have coded. This is useful when examining small snippets of coded text. You can apply this Broad context (or explore the other options in the menu) any time you are presented with a list of references.

Please note that under the **Home** tab within the program, there is the option to select 'broad' under **Spread Coding**. This is *not* the same function. While selecting broad under **Coding Context** will display the context of your code, selecting broad under **Spread Coding** will instead add the surrounding context to your original code.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Codes_13_0.png' | relative_url }}' alt='The Sustainability code opened, with grey text above and below each reference. One example outlined in red.' title='' width='595' height='369' />

14\. Close the window for now by clicking on **Close "Sustainability"** in the View drop\-down menu.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Codes_14.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Within the view tab from the mac menu bar, Close Sustainability is selected. ' title='' width='349' height='394' />

15\. Another way to get a better idea of how your files are coded is to use coding stripes and highlighting. First, **go to your interviews folder**. You can see how many codes have been applied to the content and how many references in the document have been coded.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Codes_15.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the interviews folder, the codes and references columns are outlined.' title='' width='682' height='181' />

16\. Double click on an interview that has some coded references.

17\. At the top of the selected file tab, from the **Coding Stripes drop\-down menu, select All.** Then go back into the **Coding Stripes drop\-down menu** again and **select Automatic Colors**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Codes_17.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Under the selected file, Coding stripes and All are selected. ' title='' width='445' height='377' /><img src='{{ '/assets/images/ScreenshotAutomaticColors.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Automatic Colors option from the Coding Stripes menu is highlighted.' title='' width='1460' height='735' />

18\. As you scroll through the document, you should see coloured stripes along the right to tell you what parts of the document have been coded and how. *Note that you can customize the colours if you'd like by holding down the Control key and clicking on each code, and then picking your colour of choice in the Color section. After you've set up all your colours, click anywhere on the text of the interview, select the Coding Stripes drop\-down menu, and select Item Colors instead of leaving Automatic Colors selected.*

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Codes_18.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Red box around the coloured stripes along the right of the transcript text.' title='' width='702' height='462' />

19\. At the top of the selected file tab, from the **Highlight drop\-down menu, select Coding for All Codes or Cases.**

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Codes_19.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Under the selected document, Highlight and Coding for All Codes or Cases is selected.' title='' width='769' height='253' />

20\. You will see the coded text in yellow highlighting throughout the document.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Codes_20.png' | relative_url }}' alt='The coded transcript text is highlighted in yellow and outlined with a red box.' title='' width='735' height='345' />

Note: Both Highlight and Coding Stripes can also be found in the View menu in the top menu bar.

Creating Notes
--------------

1\. Let’s move on to another use of NVivo. You can create different types of notes to capture your thoughts on some text in a file, a file itself, or the project as a whole. For example, if you want to make a note about something that has come up in the text, you would use annotations. **Open up one of the interview files** (if you don’t have one open already), **highlight some text,** **hold down the Control key and click on it,** and **select New Annotation**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Notes_1.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Some interview text selected, with an open context menu and a red box around New Annotation.' title='' width='630' height='513' />

2\. A small pop up window will appear, where you can add your note. **Type out a small note**, such as “This is important!” When you’re done typing your note, just click on the document again. You will see that annotations are highlighted in blue. You can always hover over the blue highlighted text to see the pop\-up window with the note again. **Close the file** by hovering over the file tab and selecting **X**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Notes_2.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Interview text with a annotated text highlighted and below a window with the annotation outlined in red.' title='' width='628' height='331' />

3\. Let’s say instead that you want to make a note about this whole interview file that you had open. Go to the **Interviews folder** and **hold down the Control key and click on an interview file**. Select **Memo Link** and then **Link to New Memo**...

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Notes_3.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Context menu for an interview with the Memo link side pop-up menu open and Link to New Memo... outlined in red.' title='' width='729' height='485' />

4\. **Give your memo a name**, such as “Interview Memo” and **click on Done**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Notes_4.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Memo Properties window, with the name field and Done outlined in red. ' title='' width='454' height='606' />

5\. You will be given a blank page where you can write a detailed memo about that file. Perhaps, for example, this interview was held in poor conditions, such as a noisy coffee shop, that might have influenced what was talked about. You could note that here.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Notes_5.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Red box around the interview Memo tab.' title='' width='798' height='365' />

6\. Once you close the window, the memo is saved and linked to this file. You should see a small icon next to the interview in the list.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Notes_6.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Red box around the linked Memo icon in the interview folder.' title='' width='443' height='164' />

7\. To view the memo link, **hold down the Control key and click on the file again, select Memo Link** and then **Open Linked Memo**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Notes_7.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Context menu for an interview with the Memo link side pop-up menu open and Open Linked Memo outlined in red.' title='' width='654' height='498' />

8\. To see annotations you have created all in one place, from the left menu, **under Notes, click on Annotations**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Notes_8.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Left menu with Notes outlined in red, with Annotations selected. Annotation list open' title='' width='659' height='440' />

9\. To see the memo links, **under Notes,** click on **Memos**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Notes_9.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Left menu with Notes outlined in red, with Memos selected. Memo list open' title='' width='638' height='342' />

10\. Finally, you can also create a note that applies to the entire project, for example, maybe some ideas you have about how the research is going or new themes that are emerging. **With the memos folder highlighted, go to the Create menu**, and **select Memo**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Notes_10.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the left menu Memos folder selected. In the Create menu Memo is highlighted.' title='' width='798' height='465' />

11\. **Give it a name**, such as “Project Memo” and **click on Done**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Notes_11.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Memo Properties window, with the name field and Done outlined in red. ' title='' width='572' height='740' />

12\. **Type some notes**, such as “The project needs to be reviewed” and then **close it to save it**. You can always double click on it from the list of memos to re\-open it.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Notes_12.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Red box around the Project Memo tab.' title='' width='704' height='389' />

 

Case Classification and Cases
-----------------------------

If you have demographics or other important attributes that you want to incorporate into your study, case classifications and cases can help. For example, if you were analyzing interview transcripts, you might want to create a case classification called “Interviewees” with attributes such as their name, age, education, job title, etc. Once your case classification is in place that defines what characteristics you want to capture for your interviewees, you could then create one case for each interviewee with those attributes filled in. So for example, if you interviewed someone named Geeta, you would create a case called Geeta (or some ID number if needed for confidentiality) with information about Geeta. You would then use that Geeta case to code all the files/content that are associated with Geeta (where the Case acts like a Code). Later you can then run queries that incorporate that information to answer questions such as, do executives talk more about sustainability? We will talk about how to run queries later in the tutorial.

You can manually create case classifications and cases, but often times, it is easier and more common to upload a spreadsheet with all the information for the cases. Let’s try that now.

1\. For our project, we have a file called Interviewees.csv. Open it up and take a look. It lists our interviewees and their attributes. Attributes in NVivo work best when they are categorical variables. NVivo would call this a classification sheet. Now close it and go back to NVivo.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/nvivo_workshop_mac_070.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Interviewees spreadsheet opened in Microsoft excel' title='' width='600' height='363' />

2\. Go to the Import menu,and from the **Classification drop\-down menu, select Classification Sheet...** (You can also go to the **Home menu**, and from the **Case Classification drop\-down menu, select Import Classification Sheet)**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/ScreenshotImportClassificationSheet.png' | relative_url }}' alt='The import menu is highlighted, along with the Classifications submenu and Classification sheet option.' title='' width='1312' height='308' />

3\. **Browse to the Interviewees.csv file** and **click on Open**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Case%20Classification_3.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Finder with Workshop Files opened and Interviewees.csv selected. Open highlighted.' title='' width='766' height='397' />

4\. From the Classification Type drop\-down menu, **make sure it says Case Classification**. Next for **Create new classification, type in “Interviewees”** (to give it that name) and then keep the rest of the defaults (where there should just be a checkmark next to Create new attributes if they do not exist) and **click on Next**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Case%20Classification_4.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Import Classification Window with the classification type set to Case Classification. Beside For text files Create new classification selected and Interviewees entered. Box checked off for Create new attributes if they do not exist. Red box around Next.' title='' width='647' height='477' />

5\. Our classification sheet’s first column provides the name of each case (i.e., the interviewee’s first name). Keep the defaults here (where there should be a checkmark next to 'Create new cases if they do not exist') and then **click on Next**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Case%20Classification_5.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Import Classification Window with box checked off for Create new Cases if they do not exist. Next highlighted.' title='' width='609' height='449' />

6\. Then **click on Import**. It should open up the newly created Interviewees case classification sheet and attributes.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Case%20Classification_6.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Import Classification Window with Import highlighted.' title='' width='617' height='456' />

7\. **Click on Classification Sheet** at the top of that window to see something that resembles the csv file we imported. Then close it.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Case%20Classification_7.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Imported classification sheet opened in NVivo.' title='' width='792' height='363' />

8\. From the left menu, **under Cases, click on Cases** to see our newly created cases. These cases can now be used in coding the same way codes are used.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Case%20Classification_8.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Left menu Cases opened and a red box around the Cases list' title='' width='626' height='393' />

9\. We can take advantage of NVivo’s autocoding features to allow us to identify the interviewee’s responses in a file and code them automatically into the appropriate case. From the left menu, under **Files,** **select Interviews.** **Hold down the Control key and click on the “Data Center Interview Transcript oct3\_2014” file** and **select Autocode**, and then **select By Speaker**…

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Case%20Classification_9.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the interviews folder, a context menu for the last transcript is open. Auto Code highlighted and its side pop-up menu open with by By Speaker... outlined in red.' title='' width='1590' height='1354' />

10\. First, make sure that under **What would you like to classify your cases as?** it has **Existing classification \> Interviewees** selected.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Case%20Classification_10.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Auto Code window with What would you like to classify your cases as? highlighted in red. Under it Existing classification is selected with Interviewees picked from the drop-down menu. ' title='' width='712' height='468' />

11\. Next, our transcripts are formatted in a consistent manner so we can always pick out who is speaking because the text is labeled as “INT:” for the interviewer’s words, and the person’s name in capital letters followed by a colon for the interviewee’s words. We need to tell NVivo who are all the unique speakers in this document. Under "Enter the names of the speakers. These will become your cases.", **type in “INT”** **and hit Enter**. Then **type in BASEL** **and** **hit the TAB key**. You should check the preview on the right to confirm that NVivo is picking up each unique speaker by highlighting them in different colours. If it looks correct, **click on Autocode**. This should code everything that Basel said in the transcript with Basel’s case.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Case%20Classification_11.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Under Enter the names of the speakers, INT and BASEL have been entered. On the right the interview text has been assigned corresponding colors according to the speaker. Both areas are outlined in Red. Auto Code is highlighted.' title='' width='694' height='457' />

12\. From the left menu, **under Cases, click on Cases**. Then **double click on Basel**. You should see everything that Basel said in his interview. These words are coded to this case. The BASEL case code is now linked to Basel’s interview responses.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Case%20Classification_12_1.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Cases open with Basel selected and a red box around the Basel window.' title='' width='798' height='362' />

 

Part 2 \- Queries
=================

 

In this second part of the tutorial we will be looking at queries. One advantage of putting all your documents and coding in one NVivo project, is that you then have the ability to query the information to gain more insights.

Queries work better for larger projects with a lot of coding already completed, so we’re going to work with the sample project that comes with NVivo for this next section.

This tutorial will provide you with several interspersed exercises to test your understanding. You can find the answers to these questions at the bottom of the tutorial.

 

Word Frequency and Text Queries
-------------------------------

1\. First, make sure you have saved and closed any previous projects you had open using the **File Menu** from the menu bar at the top.

2\. Then from the **File Menu or start screen, select Create Copy of Sample Project** to use a ready\-made project that comes with NVivo. Data in this sample project are drawn from a two\-year research study (2008\- 2009\) undertaken by researchers from the Duke University Nicholas School of the Environment at the Duke Marine Laboratory in Beaufort, N.C. The study documented community perceptions of development and land\-use change on coastal communities in the Down East area of Carteret County, North Carolina, USA.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_2.png' | relative_url }}' alt='The NVivo 14 main screen with Create a copy of the sample project highlighted.' title='' width='652' height='388' />

3\. A window will pop\-up asking if you want to rename the project and if you want to adjust where it saves. Let’s keep the name, but make sure it is saving with your other workshop files. **Then click on Save**. If an NVivo Tour window opens up, just close it for now.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_3.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Save window with Sample Project written in the Save As field. Save highlighted.' title='' width='316' height='191' />

4\. Next let’s see how queries can help us make sense of this project. **Go to the Explore menu** to see all the queries available to you.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_4.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Explore menu tab outlined in Red.' title='' width='798' height='131' />

5\. Let’s start with the third option – the Word Frequency query, which helps us to identify frequently occurring terms in content. This is a great query to start with to get a sense of the content or topic of your data, by looking at the most common words used in a particular file or your whole project.**Go to the Explore menu and select Word Frequency.**

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_5.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Explore menu, word Frequency highlighted.' title='' width='1494' height='242' />

6\. First, you’re asked where you want to search. This is a common setting for most queries. The default option is to search everywhere in the project. You could however, select particular files or folders that you want to search by choosing the second or third options. For example, if we only want to search Interviews, and we’ve been very organized and put all of our interview transcripts into a folder called Interviews, we could select the third option, Items in Selected Folders. However, our interview folder has a combination of text, plus audio and video files. If we want to only select the text transcripts, we’d select the second option. Let’s try that. **Choose Selected Items** for this example.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_6.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Unsaved Query menu, Selected Items highlighted.' title='' width='680' height='415' />

7\. Then **expand Files in the folder tree** to see our interview folder. **Put a checkmark next to the Interviews folder to select everything in that folder to start, but then unselect the two video files and one audio file** (that have different icons). So only the text transcripts should be selected for our search. **Then click on Select**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_7_0.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Expanded Files folder tree with the interviews folder opened and with only the documents selected. Red box around Select.' title='' width='720' height='398' />

8\. Now we can make adjustments to the settings of our word frequency query. Next to Finding matches, there are some useful settings. If you select the second option, include stemmed words, it can group a word with all its different word endings together, so they don’t take up distinct spots in our top words list. For example, “run,” “runs,” and “running” would just be grouped together and then tallied once. **Select Include stemmed words** for this example.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_8.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Unsaved Query window, include stemmed words selected.' title='' width='724' height='294' />

9\. Next, instead of 1000 words, let’s **change Display words on the left to 100 most frequent** for this example. Minimum word length can remain at 3 characters.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_9.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Unsaved Query window, under Display words, a red box around Most frequent, which is set to 100.' title='' width='679' height='306' />

10\. When all the settings are in place, **click on Run Query** **on the top right**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_10.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Unsaved Query window Run Query highlighted.' title='' width='765' height='347' />

11\. Now we should see the results of our query. You should see a list of the top most common words in our interview transcripts, sorted with most common at the top. It tells you how many times the word (or group of similar words in our case) occurred and the last column shows you what words were grouped together.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_11.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Word Frequency Results' title='' width='762' height='602' />

12\. Just to note, word frequency lists normally ignore stop words, which are really common words that wouldn’t be useful to analysis. For English, that would be words like “a,” “the,” “and,” etc. When you’re looking at this list of results, if you see a word that doesn’t really have much meaning in this context, such as “things,” you could add it to the stop words list and re\-run the query so it’ll ignore it. Let’s try an example. **Hold down the Control key and click on “things” and select Add to Stop Words List**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_12.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the results summary, context menu for the word Things open, with the Add To Stop Words List option highlighted.' title='' width='654' height='257' />

13\. Then **click on Run Query** to re\-run the query. You should see that “things” is now missing from the list.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_13.png' | relative_url }}' alt=' Red box around Run Query.' title='' width='731' height='533' />

14\. To see the Stop Words list, and even reset it, you have to **go to the File menu from the menu bar at the top**, and **select Project Properties**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_14.png' | relative_url }}' alt='File menu with Project Properties highlighted. ' title='' width='414' height='512' />

 

15\. Here in the General tab, you can select the Text Content Language. The default is English (US), but you can see other options. This doesn’t affect the interface, but is important for certain queries, such as word frequency queries and affects the stop words list. For example, you could have an English interface for NVivo, but be analyzing interview transcripts that are in French, by selecting French here. **Click on the Stop Words… button** to see the list of stop words in use and select Restore Defaults to reset the list to the default, if you wish. Let’s just **click cancel twice** for now and **go back to the results of our query**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_15.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Project Properties window with the General tab open. Red box around the Text content language and Stop Words...' title='' width='684' height='401' /><img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_15b.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Stop Words window. Red box around Ok.' title='' width='472' height='259' />

16\. You can also export these results into a spreadsheet by **holding down the Control key and clicking on the table** and **selecting Export**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_16.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Context menu for the summary table with Export... outlined in red.' title='' width='706' height='456' />

17\.**Browse to the workshop folder, give the file a name or keep the default, change the File Format to Tab Separated Value** (to make it a spreadsheet) and **click on Save**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_17.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Save query window with the Save As field filled in with Word Frequency Query. File Format is highlighted and set to Tab Separated Value. Rex box around Save.' title='' width='396' height='277' />

18\. If we go back to the query results window, just above the table, you will see two tabs: Summary and Word Cloud. We are in the Summary tab. **Click on Word Cloud**. This shows the more frequent words, where the larger the word is, the more frequently it occurs, which is a common way to display this type of result. (Might take a few seconds to load). *Note that currently there is a bug in the newer versions of NVivo, so you are unable to change the colours, but normally you can click on a Gallery button to select different themes to customize your word cloud.*

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_18.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the query results the Word Cloud tab is selected.' title='' width='754' height='599' />

19\. You can also **hold down the Control key and click on the word cloud**, and then **select Export to export it as an image or PDF** to use later in a report.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_19.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Context menu on the word cloud with Export... outlined in red.' title='' width='743' height='240' />

20\. Once you’re done looking at the results of a query, close the tab. We will cover saving queries later in the tutorial.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_20.png' | relative_url }}' alt='View menu with Close "Unsaved Query" highlighted. ' title='' width='512' height='476' />

21\. Next, let’s look at the Text Search query, which can be used to see where particular terms occur in the content. **Go to the Explore menu and select Text Search.**

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_21.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Query menu and Text Search highlighted.' title='' width='798' height='122' />

22\. You can use it to find a word or phrase. You can search for phrases by putting them in quotation marks. Let’s try **typing “family” in the search box** and choose **Include stemmed words**, so that it will also search for “families” similar to what we did in the Word Frequency query.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_22.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Text query window with family written in the Search for field and highlighted. Finding matches highlighted and included stemmed words selected.' title='' width='702' height='227' />

23\. Next, we would select where it should search. As before the default is all the documents in the project. Let’s keep the default this time and just run the query. Select **Run Query** at the top.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_23.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Text query window with Run Query highlighted.' title='' width='737' height='216' />

24\. You will be presented with a list of project files that contain that reference. You can **double click on a file to see the references**. Try that with the item called “Susan,” which you can see has 6 references.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_24.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Text Search Query window, a red box outlines the Susan file in the summary table.' title='' width='798' height='477' />

25\. This opens up Susan’s interview transcript. You can use this to help find references that you might want to code.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_25.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Red box around the open Susan file. All mentions of family a highlighted in yellow.' title='' width='606' height='390' />

26\. Go to the **View drop\-down menu,** and click on **Close "Susan"** to go back to the query results, or hover over the Susan tab and click on the X .

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_26.png' | relative_url }}' alt='View menu with Close "Susan" highlighted. ' title='' width='431' height='531' />

27\. Above the results you will see the Reference tab. You can **click on the Reference tab** to see all of the references together in one page.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_27.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Text Search Query window results with a red box around the References tab.' title='' width='714' height='484' />

28\. **Click on the final tab, Word Tree**, which shows you what words often come before and after the term or phrase you searched for. This is useful to understand how that word or phrase is being used.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_28.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Text Search Query window results with a red box around the Word Tree tab.' title='' width='1954' height='1448' />

29\. You can normally click on **family** to toggle between “family” and “families.” \[But there is a bug that sometimes crashes NVivo when toggling, so I would avoid doing this right now.]

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_29.png' | relative_url }}' alt='the drop-down menu under family opened and highlighted.' title='' width='699' height='354' />

30\. We can save the results in a code. In a way, it autocodes the search term to a new code we can call Family. **Click on Save Results…** at the top right.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Word%20and%20Text_30.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Text Search Query window, a red box outlines Save Results...' title='' width='1956' height='1132' />

31\. For the location, **click on the small arrow** and **pick Codes** and then **click on Select**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/Screenshot1.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Query save pop-up window with arrow option to adjust the location that it saves.' title='' width='832' height='456' /><img src='{{ '/assets/images/Screenshot2.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Pop-up window showing option where you can save the results: Codes, Cases or Query Results.' title='' width='798' height='788' />

32\. **Call it “Family”** and **click on Save Results.**

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/Screenshot3.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Pop-up window that allows you to name the code Family.' title='' width='828' height='446' />

33\. **Close any windows open.** Then using the left menu, **under Coding**, go to the **Codes** folder. You will see a new code called Family.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/Screenshot4.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Codes list with Family now added.' title='' width='1186' height='846' />

34\. **Double click** on the new **Family** code and **select the Reference tab** to view the results again.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/Screenshot5.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Summary view for the Family code showing project items. Reference tab highlighted.' title='' width='1562' height='958' />

35\. **Click anywhere in the references** and **press the Command key and “A”** on your keyboard at the same time to select all.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/Screenshot6.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Reference highlighted.' title='' width='2086' height='1050' />

36\. Go to the **Home menu**, and then click on the drop\-down arrow next to **Spread Coding** and **select Custom…**

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/Screenshot7.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Selecting Custom... from Spread Coding menu drop-down.' title='' width='2076' height='1286' />

37\. **Select Surrounding paragraph** and then **click on OK**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/Screenshot8.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Pop-up window with surrounding paragraph selected and OK button highlighted.' title='' width='874' height='478' />

38\. Now the coding results have changed so that instead of just the word family being coded, the coding has spread to the surrounding paragraph. So, this is a way to do some coding through text searches.

Coding Queries
--------------

1\. Okay, now let’s move on. **Close any query results tabs that you have open**.

2\. The next few queries I am going to show you are better to use when you have done some coding, as they can help you gain insight from all your work coding your content. For example, you could use these to find potential connections between codes, or connections between a code and a certain demographic.

3\. Let’s start with Coding queries. You can use these to find all content coded at selected codes, a combination of codes, or a combination of codes and attributes. So for example, let’s say you want to see if there is content coded as both “Memorable quotes” and “Real estate development,” and you only want to see references that are from residents of Marshallberg – you can do this with a Coding query. **Go to the Explore menu, and from the Query drop\-down menu, select Coding.**

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding%20Queries_3.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Explore menu, with Queries and Coding highlighted' title='' width='661' height='215' />

4\. We can keep the defaults for now, which only finds references that are coded with all the codes listed. So, we just need to **click on the arrow** next to no selected codes to select the two codes we want: **“Memorable quotes”** **and “Real estate development.” Put checkmarks next to both of these codes**, and then **click on Select**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding%20Queries_4a.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Coding query window with no selected codes highlighted.' title='' width='698' height='205' /><img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding%20Queries_4b.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Expanded Files folder tree with the Codes folder open and Memorable quotes and Real Estate development selected and outlined in red. Red box around Select.' title='' width='707' height='390' />

5\. Then **click on Run Query** to see the results.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding%20Queries_5.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Query window with Run Query highlighted.' title='' width='671' height='197' />

6\. You are shown all the results, but you can also **click on the Summary tab just above the results** to see how many results you got. We can see there are a few results in interviews and survey responses.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding%20Queries_6.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Coding Query window, a red box outlines the Summary tab.' title='' width='717' height='307' />

7\. But we can narrow this down further, to just quotes from residents of Marshallberg. To do that, we **can click on the plus sign at the top right** to add another parameter to our search.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding%20Queries_7.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Coding Query Results Preview Window, a red box around the add parameter button.' title='' width='692' height='177' />

8\. For this new row, **we** **use the drop\-down menu to select Any case where**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding%20Queries_8.png' | relative_url }}' alt='The code or case dropdown menu outlined in red with Any case where selected.' title='' width='740' height='223' />

9\. Next **click on the arrow next to no selected attribute**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding%20Queries_9.png' | relative_url }}' alt='No selected attribute highlighted.' title='' width='673' height='202' />

10\. Then **expand Person, select Township, and click Select Attribute.**

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding%20Queries_10.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Attribute list with Person highlighted and expanded and under it Township highlighted and selected. Select Attribute highlighted.' title='' width='435' height='439' />

11\.**From the far blank right drop\-down, select “Marshallberg.”** So the query says “All” at the top left, meaning all of these conditions must be true. Then one line says that the content must be coded with both of the codes, Memorable quotes and Real estate development, and then the other line says AND the person who said this must be from Marshallberg.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding%20Queries_11.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Red box around the open dropdown menu beside equals value, with Marshallberg selected.' title='' width='784' height='371' />

12\. **Click on Run Query again**. This time you can see we get just one large memorable quote on real estate from Mary and James, who are from Marshallberg. (Click on the Reference tab to read it.)

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding%20Queries_12.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Coding Query window, in the results table, a red box around the one entry.' title='' width='720' height='301' />

13\. We might not want to save the results, but we might want to save this query to re\-run again in the future as we continue to code. To do that, **click on Save Criteria**… at the top right.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding%20Queries_13.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Coding Query Window, a red box around Save Criteria...' title='' width='757' height='223' />

14\. Give it the name “Marshallberg Quotes on Real Estate” and click on **Save Criteria**. Then **close the query results tab using the View menu**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding%20Queries_14.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Save criteria window with the name field and Save Criteria highlighted. ' title='' width='503' height='269' />

15\. This query is now saved in the **Query Criteria** section on the left, under **Queries**. You can double click on it at any time to re\-open the settings for the query, where you can then re\-run it.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Coding%20Queries_15.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the left menu, under Explore, a red box around Queries and Query Criteria. In the Queries list, a red box around Mashallberg Quotes on Real Estate. ' title='' width='2342' height='1392' />

 

### Test Your Understanding 2

Run a Coding query for the project to find interview content only coded as “Infrastructure,” “Policy, management,” OR “Real estate development” where the interviewees are from Harkers Island. How many references did you find?

(Hint: You will have to change an option to say Any instead of All to satisfy the “or” condition, different than in the demonstration.)

Matrix Coding and Crosstab Queries
----------------------------------

1\. Next up are Matrix Coding queries. These allow you to see coding intersections between two lists of items. For example, let’s say you want to see which interviewees by cases had the most positive and negative attitudes based on coding \- you can do this with a Matrix Coding query. **Go to the Explore menu and select Matrix Coding.**

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Matrix%20and%20Crosstab_1%20.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Explore menu with Matrix coding highlighted.' title='' width='1748' height='250' />

2\. This query is formed using drag and drop. First, using the left menu, under **Cases, go to Cases, and then People, and then expand Interview Participants.**

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Matrix%20and%20Crosstab_2.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the left menu, under Cases, a red box around the People folder. In the People folder, a red box around the expand button for Interview Participants.' title='' width='612' height='534' />

3\. Highlight all of the interviewees by clicking on the first one, holding down the Shift key, and then clicking on the last one. Then drag and drop them on the left side of the matrix query under Rows.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Matrix%20and%20Crosstab_3.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Under Interview Participants, all cases are selected and outlined in red, with an arrow pointing to the Rows field of the Matrix Coding Query window.' title='' width='766' height='506' />

4\. Then, using the left menu, under Coding, **click on Codes**, and then **go to Attitude and expand it.**

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Matrix%20and%20Crosstab_4.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the left menu, under Codes, a red box around the Codes folder. In the Codes folder, a red box around the expand button for Attitude.' title='' width='543' height='472' />

5\.**Highlight all the attitude child codes** (similar to the cases) and then **drag and drop them on the right side of the matrix query under Columns**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Matrix%20and%20Crosstab_5.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Under Attitude, all child codes are selected and outlined in red, with an arrow pointing to the Columns field of the Matrix Coding Query window.' title='' width='798' height='504' />

6\. **Click on Run Query** to see the results. You will see a grid or matrix with the number of references where those codes and cases intersect.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Matrix%20and%20Crosstab_6.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Query window with Run Query highlighted.' title='' width='714' height='386' />

7\. To see the results more clearly and point out interesting patterns, **go to the View menu from the top menu bar.** From there, select **Coding Matrix and then select Blue\-White Shading.** 

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Matrix%20and%20Crosstab_7.png' | relative_url }}' alt='View menu highlighted. Coding Matrix Highlighted with drop-down menu open and Blue-White Shading highlighted.' title='' width='718' height='403' />

8\. We can see that the darker the colour, the more two items intersect. In this case, we can see for example that Barbara had strong positive and negative references, Thomas’s interview was more negative than positive, and William’s was only positive.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Matrix%20and%20Crosstab_8.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Matrix Coding Query window, a red box around the results table.' title='' width='798' height='516' />

9\. Once you have finished examining the results, close the query results tab using the **View menu** and selecting **Close "Unsaved Query"** or hovering over the tab and selecting the X.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Matrix%20and%20Crosstab_9.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Under the View drop-down menu, Close "Unsaved Query" is highlighted. ' title='' width='570' height='413' />

10\. Let’s move on to the last query we will look at, Crosstab queries. Crosstab queries are similar to Matrix Coding queries, but you can expand out all the categories for an attribute along the columns automatically. For example, you could determine which codes came up most by Township of respondent. **Go to the Explore menu, and from the Queries drop\-down menu, select Crosstab...**

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Matrix%20and%20Crosstab_10.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Explore menu with Queries and Crosstab highlighted.' title='' width='1748' height='376' />

11\. This query is partially formed using drag and drop. First, **using the left menu, under Coding, go to Codes. Highlight all the top\-level codes** (make sure none of the Code categories are expanded) and then **drag and drop them under Codes on the Crosstab query tab**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Matrix%20and%20Crosstab_11.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the left menu, under Codes, a red box around the Nodes folder. Under Codes, all codes are selected and outlined in red, with an arrow pointing to the codes field of the Crosstab Query window.' title='' width='2796' height='1570' />

12\. The default option for the Crosstab is codes against attributes. **Under Classification, select Person from the drop\-down menu.**

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Matrix%20and%20Crosstab_12.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Crosstab Query window, drop-down menu under Classification is open with Person highlighted.' title='' width='251' height='329' />

13\. **Under Attributes, select Township from the drop\-down menu**. This Crosstab query will create a matrix where the codes are along the rows, and for the columns, it will take all the values of one attribute (in this case, Township) and use those for the column headers. Then it will tally where they intersect.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Matrix%20and%20Crosstab_13.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Crosstab Query window, drop-down menu under Attributes is open with Township highlighted.' title='' width='280' height='606' />

14\.**Click on Run Query at the top** to see the results (might have to scroll up to the top of that window to see the button). You will see a matrix with the number of references where those codes and attributes intersect.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Matrix%20and%20Crosstab_14.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Crosstab Query window, Run Query is highlighted.' title='' width='238' height='576' />

15\. To see the results more clearly and point out interesting patterns, **click on the Results tab** above where you specified the parameters of the query**.** Under Heatmap, **select the top left option going from green to white**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Matrix%20and%20Crosstab_15.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Crosstab Query window, the Results tab is highlighted. Under Heat Map the top left option from green to white is selected.' title='' width='736' height='461' />

16\. We can now see that the darker the green, the more two items intersect in our grid now.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Matrix%20and%20Crosstab_16.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Crosstab Query Results window, a red box around the results table.' title='' width='685' height='293' />

17\. In this Results tab, at the top, you’ll see a section called Show Results As. You can change the selection, to alter what numbers are displayed in the grid. In this case, **try selecting Coding Presence**. Often times you might not have a big enough data set to gain meaning from the numerical values for coding references, for example, but you can at least see where there is an intersection at all or not. For example, we see that the codes of “Attitude” and “Sense of Community” aren’t connected to any of the townships. Normally people don’t report these numbers, but use them to gain insight into their project.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Matrix%20and%20Crosstab_17.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Crosstab Query window, the Results tab is open. Under Show results as Coding presence is highlighted. A red box around the results table.' title='' width='798' height='482' />

18\. You’ll see that NVivo also offers Coding Comparison Queries, which are used when working on a team to see how much agreement there is between team members on coding. I encourage you to play around with this query and all of the other queries we’ve already discussed on your own time to learn more.

 

### Test Your Understanding 3

Run a Matrix Coding query on social media content only, where the columns are the attitude child codes (positive, negative, etc.) and the rows are the remaining top\-level codes (Balance, Economy, etc). What two codes have the most negative references?

Next run a Crosstab query, where the rows are the top\-level codes (Balance, Economy, etc) and the Person attribute is Education Level. What code was coded the most by coding references for people whose highest level of education completed is undergraduate college?

Export Data
-----------

1\. You can export your codes as a list or its references. To export your full list of codes, **go to the Share menu, and from the Export drop\-down menu, select Export Codebook...**

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Export_1.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Under the Share tab, the Export drop-down menu is highlighted, along with Export Codebook...' title='' width='536' height='226' />

2\.You can keep the defaults to include all codes and **click on Select**. This will save your all of your codes in a document that includes a description, the number of files coded with that code, and the number of references.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Export_2.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Codebook window, Codes is selected and Select is highlighted.' title='' width='393' height='391' />

3\. Browse to where your workshop files are, name your file or keep the default, decide if you want it as a document or spreadsheet format, and then **click on OK**.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Export_3.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the Codebook window, Where is highlighted and set to NVivo Workshop. OK is highlighted.' title='' width='490' height='285' />

4\. You can also export all the references for a particular set of codes. To do this, first **select your subset of codes**. For example, **select Balance and Community Change** (hold down the Command key to select more than one item).

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Export_4.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In Codes, a red box around Balance and Community change.' title='' width='2256' height='936' />

5\. Then **go to the Share menu, and from the Export drop\-down menu, select Export Items...**

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Export_5_0.png' | relative_url }}' alt='Under the Share tab, Export is highlighted. In the Export drop-down menu, Export Items... is highlighted. ' title='' width='531' height='357' />

6\. It will ask you where to save the files, so **browse to where your workshop files are**. It will create a document for each code that contains a list of each reference, similar to what you would see if you double clicked on the code. **Open up all the files you have exported to see their contents**, if they don’t open automatically.

<img src='{{ '/assets/images/NVIVO_MAC_Export_6.png' | relative_url }}' alt='In the file menu, Workshop Files highlighted and selected. OK is highlighted.' title='' width='607' height='391' />
